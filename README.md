# (ง°ل͜°)ง Javascript Tutoring

### Mindset Check

* *Aspire toward becoming an expert, admit to being a noob.*
##### *Read*. *Look stuff up*. *Clutter your browser with tabs for every time you have to Google something*, whether out of necessity or just on a whim. 
When you don't know something, *first and foremost* go look it up - read, practice, relish in your newfound knowledge. When you forget about it a day or so later, hang your head, go look it up again, practice more. Give yourself a break; nobody gets everything on the first go-around. 

* *Embrace your failures, celebrate your successes.*
##### The vast majority of your time learning Javascript will be spent debugging i.e. *fixing shit*. 
Don't worry, we'll work on developing some skills to help make this process less disorienting - once you remove you bruised ego from the equation, you'll find that it can actually be pretty fun.

* *Write code everyday.*
##### Self-explanatory. You won't learn anything if you don't practice regularly; you won't *become proficient* at anything if you don't practice *daily*. 
My recommendation? Start as soon as you wake up - drink some water, make a coffee, ignore your pending Instagram notifications, begin coding. Even just 15 minutes to get the ball rolling will help you come back to it later in the day.

* *No, I'm not trying to spook you :)*
##### Learning programming is about *changing your brain*. 
Frustration and confusion are your brain's way of responding to the frightening and unfamiliar surroundings to which you're exposing it. Moreover, they are concrete signs of progress - emotional responses signalling an impending change. 

### Pre-Work
##### Before we begin, I'd like you to complete some readings and exercises. They're listed in order of importance - work on them concurrently or sequentially, whichever suits your learning style best. 
##### _Note that I won't expect you to pay for / complete any Codecademy Pro content - the Free track will suffice_
1. [Codecademy: Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)
Familiarize yourself with the fundamentals.

2. [MDN: "What is Javascript?"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)
A little slice of the big picture.

3. [_Javascript Allongé: Values and Expressions over Coffee_](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read#leanpub-auto-prelude-values-and-expressions-over-coffee)
An awesome takeaway to be gained here.

4. [Codecademy: Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
Say goodbye to Github Desktop - from now on, we use Git the proper way, as Linus Torvalds originally intended it.

5. [Lifehacker: Keyboard Shortcuts](http://lifehacker.com/5970089/back-to-the-basics-learn-to-use-keyboard-shortcuts-like-a-ninja)
The faster, the better.

6. [Codecademy: Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
You'll pick this up more as you go along, but go ahead and learn some basics for now.

* [_Bonus: Eloquent Javascript: Introduction & Chapter 1_](http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html)
Another great, more computer-sciencey JS intro.

##### More to come!
I'll keep you updated on how we'll be using this repo to co-work on projects and exercises.
