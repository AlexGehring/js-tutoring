# (ง°ل͜°)ง Javascript Tutoring

### Mindset Check

* Aspire toward becoming an expert, admit to being a noob.
*Read*. *Look stuff up*. *Clutter your browser with tabs for every time you have to Google something*, whether out of necessity or just on a whim. 
When you don't know something, *first and foremost* go look it up - read, practice, relish in your newfound knowledge. When you forget about it a day or so later, hang your head, go look it up again, practice more. Give yourself a break; nobody gets everything on the first go-around. 

* Embrace your failures, celebrate your successes.
The vast majority of your time learning Javascript will be spent debugging i.e. *fixing shit*. Don't worry, we'll work on developing some skills to help make this process less disorienting - once you remove you bruised ego from the equation, you'll find that it can actually be pretty fun.

* Write code everyday.
Self-explanatory. You won't learn anything if you don't practice regularly; you won't *become proficient* at anything if you don't practice *daily*. My recommendation? Start as soon as you wake up - drink some water, make a coffee, ignore your pending Instagram notifications, begin coding. Even just 15 minutes to get the ball rolling will help you come back to it later in the day.

* No, I'm not trying to spook you :)
Learning programming is about *changing your brain*. Frustration and confusion are your brain's way of responding to the frightening and unfamiliar surroundings to which you're exposing it. Moreover, they are concrete signs of progress - emotional responses signalling an impending change. 


### Pre-Work
###### Before we begin, I'd like you to complete some readings and exercises. They're listed in order of importance - work on them concurrently or sequentially, whichever suits your learning style best. 
###### _Note that I won't expect you to pay for / complete any Codecademy Pro content - the Free track will suffice_
